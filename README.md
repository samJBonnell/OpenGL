# OpenGL

A very basic foray into OpenGL with the purpose of implementing Conway's Game of Life and a basic CFD Visualizer at a later date.
This code is being developed on the fly as I read through C++ Primer so the code base is likely to improve in style, function, and clearity as time progresses.
